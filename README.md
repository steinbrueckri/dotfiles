![dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/images/dotfiles-logo.png)

Hi! These are my dotfiles that I use every day, primarily the terminal.
If you find something interesting, go ahead and take whatever you want from my dotfiles.

It is managed using [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/), a dotfile
manager. This makes it simple to set up a new computer with these files. In
order to set up a new system with these dotfiles, do the following:

## Getting Started

First of all you need yadm, this can be installed on macOS via homebrew or on
Linux via the package manager of your choice.

## macOS

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

### Install tools with Homebrew

```

## Install tools on ArchLinux

## Dotfile Testing

Tests are managed using [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core). To run tests, execute the following:

- `make`

The default make target will build a Docker image from the `.Dockerfile` and run test cases using Bats found in `.tests`.

### Missing features

Here are some planned improvements for future versions:

- Testing with multiple Neovim versions
- Testing across various Linux distributions
- Testing on macOS
